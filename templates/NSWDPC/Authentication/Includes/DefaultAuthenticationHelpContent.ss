        You can use multi factor authentication (MFA) on this website to protect your account.
    <% end_if %>
    MFA is sometimes referred to as Two Factor Authentication (2FA).
</p>

<p>
    Your passwords can become known to third parties through many methods,
    including using a common password, re-using the same password on multiple websites,
    or by having your password stolen.
<p>

<p>
    When MFA is turned on for your account, you will be asked for your password and a code provided by an
    authentication application.
</p>

<p>
    Anyone who gains access to your password will not be able to gain access to your account
    unless they also have access to your authentication application.
<p>

<p>
    The setup process only takes a minute or two.
</p>

<p>
    To set up your authentication application, you will first need to install your preferred
    application on your device. There are many MFA applications, the following list shows
    the most popular:
